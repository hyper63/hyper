# Project Meetings

All project meeting agendas and notes will be documented here. Each agenda will be published a few days before the meeting and encourage all members to provide status updates in the agenda so that we can minimize the need for complex note taking.

A template of an agenda is found in the `meetings` folder and each meeting document should be named in the following format. `yyyy-mm-dd.md` and placed in the meeting folder of the repository.
