üëã Hey üëã

Welcome to the hyper Service Framework project ‚ö°Ô∏è!

Hyper is a multi-cloud, multi-language, cloud-agnostic service framework that enables best-of-breed
cloud service utilization. By providing a simple and extensible context-bound API for common service
primitives, the hyper Service Framework decouples business services from the general purpose
services tier that powers them, positioning software for **growth** and **long term stability**.

As a result, the hyper Service Framework helps software organizations build "optimally-scaled"
software and software teams.

Hyper organizations tame technical debt, by using Clean Cloud Architecture to sensibly scale their
software and software teams, only when the complexity is needed, and not all up-front.

The hyper Service Framework documentation aims to help developers understanding the framework's
approach, how to develop using hyper, and how to host hyper on your own infrastructure.
